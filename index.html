<h2>Kassim Mwitondi</h2>
<p>Sheffield Hallam University - Africa</br></br>
      <b>Bio:</b> Kassim obtained his PhD in Statistical Data Mining in 2003 from the University of Leeds, School of Mathematics. A well–rounded multi-disciplinary professional, he also holds MSc degrees in Statistics, Computing and Finance with many years of experience in teaching, research and consulting across continents. His research interests are in extracting knowledge from multi–faceted data, using machine and deep learning techniques. A regular presenter at international conferences on data science and related fields , he has published extensively in those areas. He is a keen promoter of interdisciplinary approach to scientific research, open data and open science and he has secured and managed interdisciplinary research projects. His current research work focuses on the application of deep learning and other machine learning techniques in interdisciplinary modelling of real–life phenomena
within the domain of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)–viewing each SDG as a Big Data node.</br></br>
      <b>Interest in serving as a co-chair:</b> As an African, Diaspora, I have observed with a keen interest the gaps in capacity within the infrastructure of data access and sharing for the developing world. Across Africa, for example, these channels are fading and the gaps are reflected in the library communities around research data management. The digital revolution experienced across the developed world has not been replicated in the developing (digitally underdeveloped) world, which impedes interoperability. As an African academic in the west, with regular interactions with the continent, I will engage colleagues on the continent through libraries, institutions and data centres for a sustainable attainment of RDA's mission of interoperability, as part of SDGs attainment.  </br></br>
